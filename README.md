### Built with gatsby and bulma

The project design is highly inspired from:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2-slOJImuSc20Drbf88qvg">Classed</a> and Philip Jerga's udemy course design on next

However, you would see various of my custom additions to the core of the project. If you use any of my code please be generous to give me credits i wont :) claim your work.

Happy Coding!!!
