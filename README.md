### Built with gatsby and bulma

The  UI is highly inspired from:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2-slOJImuSc20Drbf88qvg">Classed</a> and Philip Jerga's udemy course design on next.
The idea is to build a CMS less blog handling CMS on gatsby itself for this I might use golang which i will server on heroku or will write lambda functions on netlify.

However, you would see various of my custom additions to the core of the project. If you use any of my code please be generous to give me credits i wont :) claim your work. 

Happy Coding!!!
